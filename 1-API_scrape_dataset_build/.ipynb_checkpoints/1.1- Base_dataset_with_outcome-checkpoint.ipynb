    "# A machine learning model to predict flight cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "- the ability to predict flight cancellations at least 1 week ahead of schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior studies on the topic\n",
    "https://srcole.github.io/assets/flight_delay/report.pdf - study which used classification for >15 mins late\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope: \n",
    "As this is a POC all airports are going to be too much to do. This project will be a binary classification of flights leaving Heathrow (1- cancelled 0- non-cancelled)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. create a dataset with our positive outcome variable - cancelled flights from Heathrow  \n",
    "    a. combine it with another dataset with our negative outcome variable - non cancelled flights\n",
    "2. Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. feature engineering (see below for ongoing ideas if time permits)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model performance assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weather predicted the day/week before - numerical score, encoded score\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sentiment analysis __from__ the Heathrow leadership boards Tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sentiment analysis __about__ Heathrow\n",
    "\n",
    "4. BA Union website, crawler for mentiones of #strikes\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Do # of daily covid infections affect flight cancellations? https://data.london.gov.uk/api/table/s8c9t_j4fs2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling:\n",
    "1. Depending on time/scope - we will examine whether the dataset can be used for logistic regression. \n",
    "2. Assess other models for appropriateness"
